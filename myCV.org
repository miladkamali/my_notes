   First phase of this project was A user tracker software written in
   java which tracks how user is interacting with computer. This
   program collects how much time user spend working in different
   program and what they are doing. It also tracks user actions and
   could determin if user is actually working with the system or
   not. These informations are stored locally in database. This
   program could collect data in windows and linux.

   which program perioudicly sends data to it. It also had a dashboard
   for viewing information on users.
