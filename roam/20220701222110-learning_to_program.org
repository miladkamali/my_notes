[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJbfMBROEO0][How Senior Programmers ACTUALLY Write Code]]
** finish what you have started
every time you write code some one else will look at it down the road and measure you by it
** enforce coding standard
** documenting chosen pattern
** review new patterns early on
** never create a ticket or jira task representing refactoring
management will take out these in order to save time.
incremental refactoring is the way to go.
** assume unexpected changes
