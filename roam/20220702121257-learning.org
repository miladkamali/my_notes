most people want to rush through the basic and move to the advance techniques
that seems impressive however excelence in anything is not about knowing 1000
different skills is knowing 10 fundemental techniques so deeply that you can apply them perfectly into
1000 different situation
** continuing awareness ZANSHIN
action is not complete until you have followed through and return to the state of ready again


a task is not done when you have finished the main work, it's done when you have
reviewed it carefully and fix all the small errors and make sure it's up to your
highest standard
** immovable mind or unshakable spirit FUDOSHIN

- separate your emotions from your actions
  - when you are discouraged you practice anyway
  - when you receive negative feedback you look for useful information without taking it personaly
  - when some one else achieve your goal you study their method instead of becoming jealous
