#+title: the beauty and the beast
The beauty and the beast start with a prince in a castle where he is enjoying
his lavish but empty life. in-order to fill his otherwise empty life he gathers wonders
and beautiful people around himself and lavish in ever lasting parties. he has
little sense of empathy and his heart has not feeling of love within. Constant
request for novel and beautiful things is a deep sign of futile attempt at
numbing the empty feelings he has.
