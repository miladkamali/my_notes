* improvements
** stop sub vocalization
human could speak at about 150 to 200 word per minutes when reading something if
you vocalize it in your head you are essentially limited to this speed. even
though it will increase comprehension, it's not good for reading speed.
** grouping words
instead of trying to read each word individually, you can group words and read them together.
