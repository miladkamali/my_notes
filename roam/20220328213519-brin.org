#+title: BRIN

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_Range_Index][Block Range Index]] is used to improve performance for extremely large tables it
provides similar benefits to [[id:14bace23-d757-45a2-876e-55b8841f17bf][sharding]] but without needing to explicitly declare
partitions.


BRIN essentially acts as a negative index eliminating block that do not need to
be searched early on
