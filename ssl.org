* creating a certificate chain
  [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXi3-3dEb8k][Generating SSL certificate chain in Linux]]
** generate a Root key
   openssl genrsa -out RootCA.key 4096
** generate Root certificate
   openssl req -new -x509 -days 1826 -key RootCA.key -out RootCA.crt
** generate Intermediate Certificate Authority key
   openssl genrsa -out IntermediateCA.key 4096
** create Intermediate Certificate signing request (CSR)
   openssl req -new -key IntermediateCa.key -out IntermediateCA.csr
** Generate Intermediate Certificate signed by Root CA
   openssl x509 -req -days 1000 -in IntermediateCA.csr -CA RootCA.crt -CAkey RootCA.key -CAcreateserial -out IntermediateCA.crt
** Add certificate to operating system's trust
** Generate RSA server key
** create server sertificate signing request
** sign CSR by intermediate CA

* two type of certificate authorities
** root CA
** intermediate CA
** ssl certificate chain
   the list of SSL certificate from the root certificate to the end user
   certificate represent the SSL certificate chain
* how devices react to certificates
  if a certificate is not issued by a trusted CA then it will chick to see if
  that certificate was issued by a trusted CA and so on until a trusted CA is
  found at which point a secure connection will be established.
