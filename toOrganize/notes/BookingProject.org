* planning what we need to do
** check booking website to see how it is working
** create a benchmark of how much volume can i handle 
** talk to ata about diffrent process 
** write the code that extracts information from booking
** check the database requirements
** plan for early preview
* non technical things
** help ata come up with better plans for handling situation
*** help him analyse different situations by examining extrems to know where he stands
*** play the devils advocate so the situation become more clear
*** DO NOT get involve in non technical things before dust settles
*** DO NOT make decisions for him


** think about possible outcomes( positive and negatives)
*** negative things
    - If ghods learns about what is happening at the very least he
      will be very angry at me
    - He had been working at the very least one month effectively on
      the project, i dont have this, and i might be blind sided to
      some of the errors and problems that might happen technically, I
      dont want to disappoint Ata.
      - make sure you minimize technical risks.
      - make sure ata has other options besides you or at the very
        least you are not the reason he his making these decisions.
      - DO Talk to him about these things.
    - If things go sideways there is a chance that it might effect my
      friendship with Ata negatively
      - Make SURE WE ARE ON THE SAME PAGE(what that page is i have no idea).
    - It could be consided as coup against Ghods, There will be some
      collateral damages
      - PREPARE A LIST OF ACTIONS TO COUNTER AND MINIMIZE THESE DAMAGES
      - Make a list of all possible actions of Ghods and possbile responses
    - Make sure Ata's stress is properly managed
      - Teach him what ever you know that will help him manage stress
*** positive things
    - i like the project and it's challenging enough
    - there can be financial and non financial benefits here(think about the list)
    - Become a key member is a startup 

*** what are the things that are neither good or bad here?
** my reasons to get involve
   so far based on the previous list of possible outcomes LOGICALLY i
   should not get involve, but getting involve feels like a good idea,
   WHY? what are the things that might be unknown to me( as of now)
   which makes this feels better than it should LOGICALLY?
*** hidden motives
**** Ghods
     - I do feel that he uses people
     - I also feel the net of his behavior has been positive toward me
       - negative aspects
	 - Hatam pour
	   - Raw deal 
	   - his attempt to control my behavior
	   - He did manage to convince me to continue working with him
	 - Marko- initialization
	   - the way he sold the project viewed his greed
	 - Science Direct
	   - Raw deal (I was't considered in finacial part of the project)
	     - partially my fault
       - positive
	 - mohsen
	   - I do think i was put there to prepare for his eventual
             departure
	   - 
	 - Mapsa
	   - His behavior toward camp control was questionable never
             the less I consider the net sum positive
	   - 
     - He has lots of connections which are quite useful.
**** Ata
**** Project
**** Vahid
     - I like him ( at least i think i would like him)
     - working with him do sound interesting because i get to know him
     - the fact that Ghods hates him with passion makes him
       interesting
     - 
**** Rahnama
     - I have heard their names on different occation and that makes
       them interesting
     - 
**** Alavian
**** Iran/canada
     - canada PR wasn't an option before and i still felt good, so
       it's safe to say it's not the main reason, However it's a very
       tempting proposition.
**** Navid/Mapsa
     - There is some uncertainity in mapsa which i dont like, but it's
       shrinking, because of it i dont like it to have major effect on
       my prospect(it has right now)
     - I like navid, he seems like a good person, I dont trust him
       completely, but i feel because of his principles he can be
       trusted to do certain things even if it's not in his immediate interest.
     - over all my 
**** MosharSystem
     I dont have any feeling for it except what is attached to Ghods, So it's not a factor
