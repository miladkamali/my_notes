* 
** methods to alivieate collision
*** open addressing 
    - linear probing
      putting item in the next available position
    - plus 3 rehash
    - quadratic probing
    - double hasing
*** Closed addressing  
    - chaining method
    faster lookup 
** requirements of good hashtable
*** minimize collision
*** uniform distrubution of hash table
*** easy to calculate
*** resolve
