* problems
** make sure the camps do not mix
   - it was a major headache which drained a lot of energy
** Since most people have no base, They need a guide map at the very least.
   the problem is that most of the time they have no idea what they need to 
   do so they waste time stumbling between things to figure out.
* problems
** time management
*** visits should be confirmed two weeks in advance(Dotin visit was bad timing)
*** we did not prepare Trainees for interview
*** we did not prepare their resume to make them look good
*** we needed much more evaluations before end of camp
*** project was acceptable not good
*** we did lose about 2.5 to 3 weeks of productive work
*** in the begining of project Trainiees were not ready
*** camp mixture
    - total disaster
*** project timing
**** project deadlines were relaxed due to technical difficulties
*** sprint management
**** lack of time for grooming
**** lack of definitive start and finish time
**** no backLog
** equipment and accessories
*** it took too long for ferniture to be available
*** we did have major problems with internet, still we are suffering in that department
    - 
*** PCs and laptop needs maintanance( it's out of our or trainees responsibilites)
    - at least one laptop has problem connecting to projector
    - VGA HDMI
*** projector clarity degrades over time
** learning intruptions
*** sudden introduction of hibernate
*** sudden intoruction of failure sprint
*** presure on me to be less present
*** introduction of the second camp
** change in goals
*** initially we planned for Android and over night it changed to java
*** initial plans were for Java SE and a bit of hibernate it changed in the middle of execution
     much higher 
** feedback management
*** TODO in the end and middle of camp feed backs were too little
    - get the feedback after they leave the camp
*** I need more feed back from Dotin and other places to manage the plan accordingly
