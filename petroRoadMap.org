** create one click routing system
in this method designer would select  the start and end port and it will deliver
some optimal solution considering the constraints and other pipes
*** things to be done
**** clean up current implementation
***** add direction of ports to the solver
***** fix leaks between each joints
***** fix bent calculation
**** fixing ui
***** come up with a way to show the designer which port is whitch
***** implement the 
**** packageing the system ( 1 week )
***** the plugin should be added directly to the plant 3d
****** automatic load of dll
****** automatic load of matlab runtime
***** create documents on how to set up the system
*** goal posts
**** create complete demo connecting the current version of
**** creating a proper solver instead of path finder
**** create a proper ui
***** selecting start and end port
**** integrate solver server 
** create an interactive routing system
in this method instead of plotting start to end position it will do so
interactively, suggesting different ways, updating using operator feed back,
and possibly ask the operator for general directions.

in this way our choice is to be as helpful as possible and automate as much task
that the operator need to do. in the background we can use this position to better
train our models to interact flawlessly with the designer. 
*** gether information about the problems we can solve using our system
*** 
*** data gathering
*** improvement the model
** create a whole project input and output system
