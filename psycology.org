* argument vs discussion
  discussion is meant to explore a topic and reach a mutual benefit. in a
  discussion both parties are in the same team working together. In an argument
  there is no common team. The goal is to elevate one's perspective over the
  other. the goal is winning. In discussion the more information you reveal the
  more chance of getting to a common understanding. In an argument these
  information is considered extra target to attack.
