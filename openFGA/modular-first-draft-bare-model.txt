      # Project hierarchy - projects can have parent projects
      # This allows creating nested project structures (e.g., organization -> department -> team)
      # Child projects can inherit permissions from parent projects
      # Example: project:engineering_department -> parent -> project:company
      define parent: [project]
      
      # Direct user assignments (for owners and admins)
      # Owner has full control over the project and all child projects
      # Owner permissions are inherited by child projects through the parent relation
      define owner: [user] or owner from parent
      
      # Admin users - can manage the project but don't have delete rights
      # Admins can be assigned directly or inherit from parent projects
      define admin: [user] or owner or admin from parent
      
      # Role-based access - roles assigned to this project
      # Note: project_role cannot inherit from parent because it's used in tuplesets (assignee from project_role)
      # Roles must be explicitly assigned to each project
      define project_role: [role]
      
      # Computed relations for checking access
      # A user is a member if they are assigned to a role that is assigned to this project
      # Membership can also be inherited from parent projects (through admin/owner)
      define member: [user] or assignee from project_role or member from parent
      
      # Permission checks
      # View permission: members, admins, or inherited from parent
      define can_view: member or admin or can_view from parent
      # Edit permission: admins or inherited from parent
      # Note: Users cannot be directly granted edit permission - only admins can edit
      define can_edit: admin or can_edit from parent
      # Delete permission: only owners (inherited from parent)
      define can_delete: owner or can_delete from parent
      
      # User management permission - allows managing users on the project
      # Base relation: can_manage_users_user allows explicitly granting this permission to specific users
      # This is useful when you want to grant user management rights without making someone a full admin
      # Example: Grant user:bob the ability to manage users on project:project1
      #   - object: project:project1
      #     user: user:bob
      #     relation: can_manage_users_user
      define can_manage_users_user: [user]
      
      # Computed relation: checks if a user can manage users on this project
      # Checks three conditions (in order):
      #   1. admin - admins automatically have user management rights
      #   2. can_manage_users_user - users explicitly granted this permission
      #   3. can_manage_users from parent - inherits permission from parent project in hierarchy
      # This allows flexible user management: admins always can, specific users can be granted,
      # and permissions flow down through the project hierarchy
      define can_manage_users: admin or can_manage_users_user or can_manage_users from parent
      
      # Check if user has specific access/permission through their role
      # Access objects represent granular permissions that can be granted to roles
      # Example: A role might have "write_access" which grants "write" permission
      # This allows checking: "Does this user have access:write_access on this project?"
      # Access can also be inherited from parent projects
      define has_access: [access] or has_access from project_role or has_access from parent

  type role
    relations
      # Users assigned to this role
      # The condition not_expired_grants ensures that only non-expired grants are valid
      # When assigning a user to a role, you can include expiration_time in the context
      # Example: assignee relation with expiration_time in the tuple context
      define assignee: [user with not_expired_grants, user]
      
      # Permissions/access this role grants
      # Access objects are assigned to roles to grant specific capabilities
      # Example: role:developer might have access:write_access assigned to it
      # This creates a reusable permission bundle that can be shared across roles
      # Access can be inherited from parent roles (e.g., "admin" role inherits from "member")
      # Usage: Assign access objects to roles, then assign roles to projects
      define grants_access: [access] or grants_access from parent
      
      # Role hierarchy (for role inheritance)
      # e.g., "admin" role can inherit from "member" role
      define parent: [role]
      
      # Delegation permission - allows users with this role to delegate permissions to others
      # Can be set directly on roles (by assigning the role to itself)
      # Note: Cannot inherit from parent because it's used in tuplesets (assignee from can_delegate)
      # Example: role:manager has can_delegate, so users with manager role can delegate access
      define can_delegate: [role]
      
      # Computed: users with this role
      define members: assignee
      
      # Check if role has specific access (through direct grant or inheritance)
      # This allows querying: "Does role:developer have access:write_access?"
      # Access can be directly assigned to the role or inherited from a parent role
      # Example: If role:senior_dev has access:write_access, and role:developer
      # inherits from role:senior_dev, then role:developer also has access:write_access
      define has_access: grants_access or has_access from parent
      
      # Specific permission flags for roles
      # These can be set directly on roles (by assigning the role to itself) or inherited from parent roles
      define can_edit: [role] or can_edit from parent
      define can_manage_users: [role] or can_manage_users from parent
      
      # Users who can edit/manage through this role (computed based on role permissions)
      define users_who_can_edit: assignee
      define users_who_can_manage_users: assignee
      
      # Users who can delegate through this role (only if role has can_delegate permission)
      # This allows checking: "Can user:dave delegate?" (yes, if they're assigned to role:manager which has can_delegate)
      define users_who_can_delegate: assignee from can_delegate

  type access
    # Access objects are reusable permission bundles that can be assigned to roles
    # Think of access as a "permission package" - it groups related permissions together
    # Example: access:write_access might grant permission:write and permission:edit
    # This allows you to define common permission sets once and reuse them across roles
    # 
    # Access vs Direct Permissions (can_edit, can_view):
    # - Direct permissions (can_edit, can_view) are simple boolean checks on projects/roles
    # - Access objects provide more granular, reusable permission bundles
    # - Use access when you need to group multiple permissions or reuse them across roles
    # - Use direct permissions for simple, project-specific checks
    relations
      # What permissions this access object grants
      # An access object can grant one or more specific permissions
      # Example: access:write_access -> grants_permission -> permission:write
      # This creates a link: "write_access grants the write permission"
      # Multiple permissions can be linked to the same access object
      define grants_permission: [permission]
      

  type permission
    # Permissions are leaf nodes representing specific actions or capabilities
    # They are the atomic units of authorization - the smallest grantable privilege
    # Examples: "read", "write", "delete", "manage_users", "view_reports", "export_data"
    # 
    # Permission Hierarchy:
    # 1. Permission: The atomic action (e.g., permission:write)
    # 2. Access: Groups permissions together (e.g., access:write_access contains permission:write)
    # 3. Role: Has access objects assigned (e.g., role:developer has access:write_access)
    # 4. Project: Has roles assigned (e.g., project:project1 has role:developer)
    # 5. User: Assigned to roles (e.g., user:bob is assignee of role:developer)
    # 
    # Result: user:bob -> role:developer -> access:write_access -> permission:write
    # This allows checking: "Can user:bob perform permission:write on project:project1?"
    # 
    # No relations needed - permissions are identified by their type name
    # They are referenced through access objects, not directly assigned to users or roles

  # Condition: Check if an access grant is still valid (not expired)
  # This condition is used to enforce time-based access control
  # Parameters:
  #   - current_time: The current timestamp (typically provided by the system)
  #   - expiration_time: The timestamp when the grant expires (stored in tuple context)
  # Returns: true if current_time < expiration_time (grant is still valid)
  # 
  # Usage: Applied to role assignee relations to ensure expired role assignments are invalid
  # Example: When checking if user:bob is assignee of role:developer, this condition
  # verifies that the assignment hasn't expired based on the expiration_time in the tuple context
  condition not_expired_grants(current_time: timestamp, expiration_time: timestamp) {
    current_time < expiration_time
  }
