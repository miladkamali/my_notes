* phase 2
** Middle ware
*** restructure model writer code ( 2 weeks )
The goal is to use proper software engendering practices for our prototype
*** user interface
**** design how user is supposed to interact with the plugin
At the moment we have specified a command that would prompt the user to select a
component and port
**** understand plant3d UI components ( 2 weeks)
Depending on the design of the previous, to implement required UI, we need to
investigate how plant3d custom UI system works. If we continue using command
interface we can skip this step
**** implement the user interface( 3 days - 3 weeks depending on the level of complexity of the UI )
In case of continuation of command interface there is fairly little time required in this section
*** scene data extraction module (6 weeks)
The goal of this module is to export scene information for solver
**** Query/list scene components ( 1.5 week )
**** define export interface for all the components types ( 1 week)
for some basic components like pipe, bend this interface has already been
defined however for more complex components types and supports we need to design
this interface.
**** implement export interface (1.5 week)
**** Mapping scene components to their p&id counterparts (2 weeks)
***** identify related component
***** identify related ports
*** export information from P&Id (4 weeks)
**** investigate P&ID plant3d interface(2 weeks)
**** extract p&id information (2 weeks)
***** query/list components***** phenotype generation module
***** gene mutation/crossover module
***** fitness evaluation module
