** TODO IPG issue
*** DONE u-id.net
CLOSED: [2023-07-15 Sat 17:58]
the problem is we are hosting everything under uid.ir  however IPG only recognize the u-id.net


sub-domain like bff.u-id.net and payment.u-id.net could be remedy for the situation.
*** TODO introduce IBANs to ap that we are going to use to split money

** TODO add reason for rejection
should add reason for status, the same that i had this morning
*** rejection reasons
**** can not identify the face
**** two faces in the video
**** live image not matching the reference image
**** liveness is rejected
**** profile do not match ('live image' is redundant)
*** accept condition

** TODO contact the CTO or any one in charge to discuss bunch of these things :call:
** DONE should we reject if profile image do not match the liveness?
CLOSED: [2023-07-15 Sat 16:41]

are going to reject them
