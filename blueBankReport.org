* things that had been done so far
** Architecture research
   we have compared and continue to compare different microservice architecture 
** design communication between clients and MIB
** create the MIB monolithic backend
   it is done to facilitate client development before finalizing the
   architecture of MIB. Even though it is designed as a monolith, it is
   seperated into several component to easily split into microservices. This
   process serves to iron out any issue we will have with clients related to the
   technilogy stack we have chosen.
** clean up CUFX customization
   since MIB is supposed to talk to the bank channels and we have not recieved
   solid design from them, this step became necessory to participate in the api
   design process while moving MIB forward
*** Understanding communication protocol and models in CUFX
*** cleaning up swagger documentation
*** talking to Dr and mr akbari for further clarification and customization
** create CUFX mock server
   - to enable us moving forward before actually reciveing channels from the upstairs
   - to enable testing
*** mocking card
*** mocking account
*** mocking transfer
*** mocking transaction
