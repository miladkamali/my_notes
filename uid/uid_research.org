** webhook
   trigger the server to send requests to the call back URL provided
   by the client 
*** cons
**** server has to ensure delivery through retries
**** apps running behind a firewall has to expose call-back url to the outside
**** several events happening can be quite noisy
** websocket
*** pros
**** bidirecetional low latency communication
**** reduced overhead of http requests
*** cons
**** clients are responsible for connections
**** Scalibility can be a challenge
** http streaming
*** chunked
*** Server-Sent-Events(SSE)
    twitter uses SSE to sent tweet updates over a single http connection
**** pros
***** can stream over simple HTTP
***** Native browser support
**** cons
***** bidirectional communication is challenging
***** Buffering related issue
      clients and proxies and buffering limits, they might not even
      start to process data after the buffer is filled
** GRPC
** short polling
** long polling
** Server Send Events
