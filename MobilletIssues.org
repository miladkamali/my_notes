* things to fix
** lack of proper planning
*** grooming without knowing the full scope is fools errand
*** sprints should be planned after the grooming not before
*** capacity of teams needs to calculated
*** there is no specific time for maintenance
    getting free time after burnout is not maintenance time. it needs specific
    portion of each sprint to be dedicated to maintenance and improvement and
    documentation.

*** we get punished if a sprint is not successful but there are never gratitude for success or maybe 
*** there is a growing tendency of micro-managing everything.

** development
** burnout
